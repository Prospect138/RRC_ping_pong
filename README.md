# RRC ping pong
This is a task for "НТР" bootcamp. It represent connections of UE and eNB via RRC messages.
# How to use
1) At first, run file build_server.sh from /rrc_server. It would build and run server. Keep it in terminal.
2) And then, run file build_client.sh from /rrc_client. It would build and run client.
After this, client would connect to server and they will start to communicate with RRC messages and print some data in cout.
